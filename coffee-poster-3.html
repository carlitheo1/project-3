          <p class="broke-bear-featured-item-description">Part three of my Coffee Poster Series. Dubbed "Stay Strong", this poster was created in the first half of 2022 when the Covid pandemic was still looming over most of our heads. This poster, the more somber of the three posters, encourages people to stay strong for their loved ones while in quarantine and to look forward to meeting them in person one day. The poster is a mix between hand-drawing and digital coloring and displays a single to-go cup of coffee surrounded by coffee beans with facial expressions. This poster is meant to encourage those who may not have loved ones within reach to make new friends with those who show up to the event. </p>
